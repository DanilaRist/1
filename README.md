## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://gitea.koodsisu.fi/denyshorban/racetrack.git `

2. Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Navigate to the project directory and run:

`npm install`

### Environment Variables
You must set the following environment variables before starting the server. The variables are stored in the **.env** file in the root of the project. These keys are used to secure access to different employee interfaces.

**RECEPTIONIST_KEY:** Access key for the Front Desk Interface.  
**OBSERVER_KEY:** Access key for the Lap-line Tracker Interface.    
**SAFETY_KEY:** Access key for the Race Control Interface.

### Exposing Interfaces with LocalTunnel
To make the user interfaces accessible on different networks, we use LocalTunnel. LocalTunnel creates a public URL for your local server, allowing you to share it with others.

####  Setting Up LocalTunnel
LocalTunnel is already included as a dependency and configured in the project. Follow these steps to use it:

#### Start the Server:
- **For production mode:**

`npm start`

This command starts the server in production mode and also launches LocalTunnel to expose the interfaces.

- **For development mode (with a 1-minute race timer):**

`npm run dev`

This command starts the server in development mode (with a 1-minute race timer) and launches LocalTunnel.

- **If you prefer to run the server locally without using LocalTunnel, use the following command:**

`node server.js`

####  Access Public URL:

After running the server, LocalTunnel will provide a public URL.
This URL will be logged in the terminal and can be used to access the interfaces remotely.
It typically looks like https://your-subdomain.loca.lt. Follow instructions on the page to activate URL.

### Access the Interfaces:
Open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URLs for each interface (see [User Interfaces](#user-interfaces)).
If your using LocalTunnel use the public URL to access different interfaces by appending their routes.

### User Interfaces
Each user interface serves a specific role in managing the racetrack operations and informing participants. Hereâ€™s a guide to each interface:

#### Front Desk Interface
- **Route:** /front-desk  
- **Access Key:** receptionist_key

### Security
Employee interfaces are protected by access keys. Users must enter the correct access key to configure races, input lap times, or issue commands. If an incorrect access key is entered, a 500ms delay is introduced, and an error message is displayed.

### Persisting Data
The system now persists data using an SQLite database. The database schema includes tables for race sessions, drivers, laps, ongoing races, last finished races, race status updates, and the leaderboard.
This ensures that all race data, driver assignments, lap times, and race status updates are stored and can be reinstated when the server restarts.
The database is initialized in **racetrack.db** and is managed through the sqlite3 library.
